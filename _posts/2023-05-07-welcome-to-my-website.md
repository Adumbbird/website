Hello! 

I'm adam and this is my website. I founded BirdsBored LLC in order to keep me motivated in my quest to make a video game. I've always wanted to make a game but I would always lose focus and either start a new project or move to a different one. I have branched out a little, I think BirdsBored will hold all of my projects. I'll post blog posts featuring what i'm working on at the moment, aswell as keep a list of projects for you to see. 

I hope you enjoy your time here, and hopefully I'll make something that you can enjoy. Whether it's a video game, software, or a home automation project, It'll all be open for you.

Thanks again for checking this out!

Adam.
