Hello!

This is mainly a test to make sure I added the category correctly to have it show up the way I want it to.

I do use ue5 for game development as I fell in love with the way lighting works in the engine. I just hope I can make something fun. 

I have a goal of releasing a product on steam by the end of 2023.

Adam
