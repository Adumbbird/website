I've been a fan of photography for a while now, and I'm taking it more seriously.

I upgraded my old camera to a Nikon Z5 and have commited to an Adobe subscription for Lightroom. I can edit pictures on the fly or wait till I'm at home to take advantage of my desktop computer. 

I have a portfolio at https://photos.birdsbored.com. It's convenient that they have an easy to display connection with lightroom itself so I can link to this main website, and the portfolio from adobe.
