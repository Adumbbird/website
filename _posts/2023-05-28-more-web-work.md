Web development is odd. Starting from scratch kinda blows so I opted to utilize a template. I like the functionality of Jekyll and using Github pages to host everything. By using the template, It adds a ton of features that I'd have to discover and add myself. I'm stil not too sure on how it will last long term. But I'm tempted to create a new site and borrow bits and pieces from the template. At least that way I would understand what every piece does and I'd know how to change a specific feature on the site. 

I'm going to keep using this template in the meantime to keep up the learning process. I havent figured out how to get Disqus commenting to work. It would be easier to impliment it from a fresh slate instead of walking through the code and getting the template to work. 

Either way there is a lot more functionality I'm missing before I worry about that.
