With the recent work I did getting azure to post new Humble Bundles to a discord channel, I thought about becoming a partner. It was super easy to get set up.

All I did was apply at (ENTER PARTNER LINK APPLICATION HERE). 

I filled out a code for folks to use, as well as a display name. I then gave them the legal name that payments would be made out to. 

Now that i've done that. I updated the HumbleBundleBot to go ahead and include my partner link at the end of every bundle. What that will do is make BirdsBored-LLC show up under the "Customize Adjustments" field. The company will (by default) get a small percentage of the bundle price. The rest will go to Humble Bundle themselves, or to a charity. You can adjust the proceeds if you'd like. This way you can send more to charity, more to BirdsBored, or more to HumbleBundle. 

I hope this helps!

Adam
